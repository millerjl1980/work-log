# Digital Work Log

A structured repository to track weekly tasks, projects, and learning goals—designed to integrate with my portfolio website and support quarterly/annual reviews.

## Structure
```
work-log/
├── goals/          # Annual/quarterly objectives (e.g., `2024.md`)
├── projects/       # Project details (e.g., `portfolio-website.md`)
├── weekly/         # Weekly updates (e.g., `2023-10-16.md`)
└── README.md       # This file
```
## Key Features

Goal Alignment: Tasks link to projects/goals (e.g., #goal-master-react).
Learning Focus: Tracks skills acquired (e.g., "Learned React Context API").
Portfolio Integration: Cross-links to GitHub PRs, design docs, or live demos.

## How to Use
```
Weekly Updates: Add tasks to weekly/YYYY-MM-DD.md with tags (e.g., #learning).
Projects: Document outcomes in projects/[name].md (e.g., tech stack, impact).
Goals: Define annual objectives in goals/YYYY.md (e.g., success metrics).
```
## Example Workflow
```
# Weekly Log: 2023-10-16
- [x] Debugged dark mode toggle (#project-portfolio) → [PR #123](link)
- [x] Wrote design doc for API changes (#learning) → [Notion Doc](link)
```
## Why This Matters
Visibility: Showcases process (not just outcomes) to collaborators.
Automation: Scripts can generate quarterly summaries from tagged entries.
